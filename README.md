# SMS Spammer

This is a Spam Classifier web application built using Flask and deployed on Heroku platform.
The app takes a message/email as an input and predict the message/email as spam or not spam (ham).

## Live Link

https://aqueous-depths-89669.herokuapp.com/

## Novelty

1. Designed the complete frontend and backend.
2. Created dummy dataset for testing purpose.
3. Trained for different models.
4. Done hyperparameter tuning for classification
5. Only certain extensions allowed so that no invalid file has to be processed.
6. Live project that can be accessed from anywhere. 

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* pip
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
### Installation

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zabhitak/recruitData
   ```
3. Install python packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r 
   ```
4. Run the project on localhost
   ```sh
   Visit http://localhost:****
   
   ```


## Steps Involved:

1. Open the web link
2. The files are pre-processed(removed duplicates and invalid entries) and best trained model is being imported.
3. User put its value for the given input
4. Output result will shown on the same page

## Challenges

1. Input list is not allowed in classification, so make it as dataframe.
2. Hyperparameter for different cross validations.
3. Deploying on heroku using flask.

## Future Scope

1. Account authentication for different users who use this website.
2. More fields could be added in the dataset such as skills, branch to make model more useful.

## Requirements

1. Working Internet connection (around 2 Mbps)
